    "steps": [
      "Rinse the clams in several changes of cold water and drain well.",
      "Place the clams into a large pan with 500ml of water. Cover, bring to the boil, and simmer for 2 minutes until the clams have just opened.",
      "Pour the contents of the pan into a colander over a bowl to catch the clam stock. When cool enough to handle, remove the clams from their shells, reserving a handful of empty shells for presentation if desired.",
      "Strain the clam stock into a jug, leaving any grit in the bottom of the bowl. You should have around 800ml of stock.",
      "Heat the butter in the same pan and cook the bacon for 3-4 minutes until it starts to brown.",
      "Stir in the finely chopped onion, thyme, and bay leaf, and cook gently for 10 minutes until the onion is soft and golden.",
      "Sprinkle over the flour and stir to make a sandy paste; cook for 2 minutes more.",
      "Gradually stir in the clam stock, then the milk and cream.",
      "Add the diced potatoes, bring to a simmer, and cook gently for 10 minutes or until the potatoes are tender.",
      "Use a fork to crush a few potato chunks against the side of the pan to help thicken the soup, keeping most chunks intact.",
      "Stir in the clam meat and reserved shells, if using, and simmer for a minute to reheat.",
      "Season with plenty of black pepper and a little salt if needed, then stir in the chopped parsley just before serving.",
      "You nailed it! Grab a plate and dig in."
