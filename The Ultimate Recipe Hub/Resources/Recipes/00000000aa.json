      "Add olive oil to an 8-inch skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot but not at the smoking point, crack open the eggs, one at a time, letting each egg set.",

      "Place a piece of toast on each plate, top with an egg.",
      "Pour off and discard any excess oil and remove any oily residue from the pan. Put the pan back over medium heat.",
      "Add the balsamic vinegar and let it sizzle and reduce slightly for a moment or two. Drizzle over the eggs.",
      "Garnish with arugula and serve.",
