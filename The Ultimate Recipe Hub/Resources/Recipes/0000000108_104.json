      "Boil the broccoli and carrots in a pan of water until tender, then drain and set aside.",
      "For the Yorkshire puddings, drizzle a little sunflower oil evenly into a 12-hole non-stick muffin tin and place in the oven to heat through.",
      "In a bowl, beat the plain flour and eggs until smooth. Gradually add the milk, continuing to beat until the mixture is completely lump-free. Season with salt and pepper.",
      "Pour the batter into a jug. Remove the hot muffin tin from the oven and carefully pour the batter evenly into the holes.",
      "Place the tin back in the oven and bake undisturbed for 20-25 minutes until the puddings have puffed up and browned. Serve immediately.",
      "Plate the roasted beef, potatoes, broccoli, and carrots. Add the Yorkshire puddings and gravy as desired.",
