      "Brown the chicken pieces in batches on both sides, seasoning with salt and pepper. Avoid overcrowding the pan. Remove the browned pieces and set aside.",
      "Add a bit more olive oil to the casserole and sauté the sliced onions over medium heat for 10 minutes, stirring frequently until softened but not browned.",
      "Add the remaining olive oil, then the sliced red bell peppers, and cook for another 5 minutes.",
      "Incorporate the chorizo, sun-dried tomatoes, and sliced garlic, cooking for an additional 2-3 minutes.",
      "Add the basmati rice, stirring to ensure it is well coated with the oil.",
      "Stir in the tomato puree, paprika, bay leaves, and chopped thyme.",
      "Pour in the chicken stock and dry white wine.",
      "Once the liquid starts to bubble, reduce the heat to a gentle simmer.",
      "Press the rice down into the liquid if it's not fully submerged, and place the browned chicken pieces on top.",
      "Cover the casserole and cook in the preheated oven for 50 minutes.",
      "Check that the rice is cooked but still has some bite, and that the chicken juices run clear when pierced. If necessary, cook for an additional 5 minutes and check again.",
      "Smells amazing, doesn’t it? Now take a well-earned bite!"
