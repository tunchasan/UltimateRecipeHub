      "Rinse adzuki and kidney beans separately under cold water. Place each type of bean in separate bowls, cover with water, and add a generous pinch of salt. Let soak overnight.",
      "Drain and rinse the beans. In separate saucepans, cover each type of bean with fresh water, add a pinch of salt, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until beans are tender but not mushy, about 30 minutes for adzuki beans and 45 minutes for kidney beans. Drain and set aside.",
      "In a large pot, combine kabocha squash chunks with 4 cups of water and a pinch of salt. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cover and cook until squash is tender, about 20 minutes.",
      "Add sweet potatoes and chestnuts to the pot with the squash. If needed, add more water to just cover the ingredients. Return to a simmer, cover, and cook until all vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes.",
      "While the vegetables are cooking, prepare the jujube garnish by slicing the pitted jujubes into thin rings. Set aside.",
      "Once the vegetables are tender, use a potato masher or the back of a spoon to mash the squash and sweet potatoes into a coarse pur√©e, leaving some chunks for texture.",
      "Stir in the cooked adzuki and kidney beans. Adjust the consistency of the porridge by adding more water if necessary. Season with salt to taste.",
      "In a small bowl, mix sweet rice flour with 1/2 cup of water to form a smooth batter. Drizzle the batter into the simmering porridge, stirring gently to create small dumplings. Cook for an additional 5 minutes, until the dumplings are cooked through.",
      "Stir in the sliced jujubes and cook for another 2 minutes to warm them through.",
      "Serve the porridge hot, garnished with additional jujube slices if desired."
