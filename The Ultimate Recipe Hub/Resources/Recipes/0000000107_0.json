      "Prepare the brisket by trimming excess fat and scoring the remaining fat in a cross-hatch pattern. Season generously with salt and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.",
      "Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C).",
      "In a large oven-proof pot or Dutch oven, sear the brisket fat-side down over medium-high heat until browned, about 5-8 minutes. Flip and brown the other side. Remove and set aside.",
      "In the same pot, sauté chopped onions and garlic until lightly browned. Tie together the thyme, rosemary, and bay leaves, and add to the pot.",
      "Return the brisket to the pot, add beef stock, and bring to a boil. Cover and transfer to the oven. Cook for 3 hours, flipping the brisket every hour.",
      "Add chopped carrots to the pot, cover, and cook for an additional hour until the carrots are tender and the brisket is fork-tender.",
      "Remove the brisket and let it rest under foil. Discard the herb bundle.",
      "Optional: Blend the remaining liquid and onions to create a smooth sauce. Stir in mustard for added flavor.",
      "Slice the brisket against the grain and serve with the cooked vegetables and sauce.",
      "Great work, chef! Now it’s time to enjoy your delicious creation."
