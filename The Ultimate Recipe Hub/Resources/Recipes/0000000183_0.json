      "Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.",
      "Drizzle the cut sides of the acorn squash halves with 1 tablespoon of olive oil and season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper. Place them cut side down on the prepared baking sheet.",

      "Roast the squash and garlic for 35 to 45 minutes, or until the squash is fork-tender.",
      "Once cool enough to handle, scoop the flesh from the squash halves, measuring 2 1/2 cups for the soup.",
      "In a large pot, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped onion and carrots, and sauté until softened, about 5 to 7 minutes.",
      "Peel the roasted garlic and add it to the pot along with the roasted squash flesh, fresh thyme, ground nutmeg, cayenne pepper, and vegetable broth. Stir to combine.",
      "Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and let it simmer for 20 minutes to allow the flavors to meld.",
      "Using an immersion blender or working in batches with a regular blender, puree the soup until smooth and creamy.",
      "Stir in the fresh lemon juice and maple syrup. Taste and adjust seasoning with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper as needed.",
      "Serve the soup warm, garnished with your choice of toppings such as toasted pepitas, microgreens, or a drizzle of coconut milk."
