      "Preheat the oven to 325°F.",
      "In a medium saucepan, combine pineapple preserves, pineapple juice, soy sauce, paprika, ½ teaspoon salt, and chili flakes. ",
      "Simmer over medium heat for 5 minutes until the preserves melt. Remove from heat and stir in scallions. Set aside to cool.",
      "Pat duck breasts dry. Score the skin in a cross-hatch pattern, taking care not to pierce the flesh. Season both sides with 1 teaspoon salt. Apply Poultry Seasoning to the flesh side only.",
      "Place duck breasts skin-side down in a cold, oven-safe skillet. Cook over high heat for 10 minutes to render fat. ",
      "Reduce heat to medium and cook for 5 minutes until the skin is golden and crispy. Drain excess fat as needed.",
      "Flip the breasts and sear the flesh side for 3–4 minutes. Sear the sides for about 1 minute each. ",
      "Transfer the skillet to the oven, flesh-side down, and bake for 5–6 minutes to an internal temperature of 135°F for medium doneness.",
      "Remove the duck breasts from the oven and let them rest for 5 minutes before slicing into 1-inch pieces.",
      "Serve sliced duck breasts with the pineapple-scallion sauce, warmed slightly if needed.",
      "A little effort, a lot of flavor—dig in and savor!"
