      "Warm the flour tortillas in a dry skillet or microwave until pliable.",
      "To assemble each burrito, lay a tortilla on a flat surface. Place a handful of fresh spinach leaves in the center, followed by 1/2 cup of Spanish rice, 1/4 cup of the seasoned black beans, a few slices of charred red bell pepper, 1/4 cup of guacamole, a tablespoon of pickled red onions, a sprinkle of chopped cilantro, and a few jalapeño slices, if desired.",

      "Repeat with the remaining tortillas and fillings.",
      "Serve the burritos immediately, or wrap them tightly in foil for later consumption. They can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."
