      "Preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan)/400°F/Gas 6. Butter four small (about 200ml) ramekins and sprinkle the Parmesan inside, turning to coat all sides.",
      "In a large saucepan, gently heat the milk with the bay leaves until it reaches a boil. Remove from heat and let it infuse for 15 minutes.",
      "Discard the bay leaves, then add the butter and flour to the milk. Return to low heat and simmer gently, stirring continuously with a balloon whisk, for about 6 minutes until a smooth, thick white sauce forms.",
      "Transfer the sauce to a large bowl and stir in the mustard powder, cayenne pepper, Gruyère, and egg yolks until fully combined.",
      "In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until soft peaks form. Carefully fold the egg whites into the cheese mixture in three stages, folding gently to maintain the airy texture.",
      "Divide the soufflé mixture among the prepared ramekins. Top each with a slice of goat's cheese and place them on a baking tray.",
      "Bake for 20-25 minutes until the soufflés are well risen and springy to the touch.",
      "Allow the soufflés to cool, then run a knife around the edge of each dish to remove them. If preparing in advance, place the soufflés upside down on a tray, cover with cling film, and refrigerate for a few days or freeze for up to 1 month.",
      "When ready to serve, preheat the oven to 200°C (180°C fan)/400°F/Gas 6. Place the upside-down soufflés in a shallow baking dish, top with the remaining goat's cheese slices, and pour over the double cream. Bake for 8-10 minutes until golden.",
      "Serve immediately alongside simply dressed salad or sautéed spinach.",
      "Enjoy your dish, and remember: great food is made with love!"
