      "Score the duck skin in a cross-hatch pattern, avoiding the flesh. Season both sides with salt.",
      "Place the duck breast skin-side down in a cold skillet. Cook over medium-low heat for 10-15 minutes until fat renders and skin crisps. Flip and cook 2 minutes for medium-rare (135°F). Rest while making the sauce.",

      "Add Port and blueberries, reducing until syrupy, about 10 minutes. Stir in vinegar and fish sauce, then remove from heat and whisk in butter until glossy.",
      "Slice duck breast thinly, serve over the sauce, and garnish with scallion greens and black pepper. Pair with roasted potatoes or a side salad."
