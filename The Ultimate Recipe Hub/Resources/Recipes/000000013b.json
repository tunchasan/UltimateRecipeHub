      "Add a small pinch of salt and sesame oil to minced beef. Mix well and set aside.",
      "Mix 1 tablespoon of cornstarch with 2 and Â½ tablespoons of water in a small bowl to make water starch.",
      "Cut tofu into square cubes (around 2cms). Bring a large amount of water to a boil and then add a pinch of salt. Slide the tofu in and cook for 1 minute. Move out and drain.",
      "Heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a wok, fry the minced meat until crispy. Transfer out beef and leave the oil in.",
      "Fry doubanjiang for 1 minute over low heat, then add garlic, scallion whites, ginger, and fermented black beans. Cook for 30 seconds until aromatic. Then mix in pepper flakes.",
      "Add water to the seasonings and bring to a boil over high heat. Gently slide in the tofu cubes. Add light soy sauce and beef. Reduce heat after boiling and simmer for 6-8 minutes. Then add chopped garlic greens.",
      "Stir the water starch and then pour half of the mixture into the simmering pot. Wait for around 30 seconds and then pour in the other half.",
      "Taste the tofu and add a pinch of salt if needed. If it's too spicy, adding some sugar can mellow the taste. Be careful as the broth is very hot at this point.",
      "Transfer out when almost all the seasonings stick to tofu cubes. Sprinkle Szechuan peppercorn powder (to taste) and chopped garlic greens if using. Serve immediately with steamed rice.",
      "You nailed it! Grab a plate and dig in."
