      "Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet. Sauté the chopped onions and bell peppers until softened, about 7-10 minutes. Add the minced garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 minutes until fragrant.",
      "Return the cooked eggplant and zucchini to the skillet with the onion, bell peppers, and garlic. Stir in the chopped tomatoes, white wine vinegar, fresh thyme, a pinch of sugar, and red pepper flakes. Season with sea salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste.",
      "Simmer the mixture over low heat, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables are tender and the flavors have melded together, about 20-30 minutes.",
      "Remove the skillet from heat and stir in the chopped fresh basil. Taste and adjust seasoning as needed.",
      "Serve the ratatouille warm or at room temperature, drizzled with a bit of extra-virgin olive oil and accompanied by crusty bread."
