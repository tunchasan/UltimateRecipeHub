      "In a sauté pan, simmer white wine over medium heat until reduced by half, about 3–5 minutes.",
      "Lower the heat to medium-low, then whisk in 2 tablespoons of butter one at a time until emulsified.",
      "Stir in the cream, saffron liquid, and a pinch of salt. Simmer for 2 minutes until slightly thickened. Remove from heat.",
      "Cook pasta according to package instructions or until al dente. If using fresh pasta, cook for 2–3 minutes.",
