      "Preheat your oven to 350°F (175°C).",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, Dijon mustard, honey, thyme, mustard powder, garlic powder, salt, and pepper to make the marinade.",
      "Place the chicken breast in a shallow dish and pour half of the marinade over it, turning the chicken to coat evenly. Let it marinate for 10-15 minutes.",
      "Heat a skillet over medium-high heat. Add a small amount of oil and sear the marinated chicken breast on each side for about 3 minutes, until golden brown.",
      "Transfer the seared chicken to an oven-safe dish, pour any remaining marinade from the skillet over it, and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 165°F (74°C). ",
      "Remove from the oven and let it rest for 5 minutes before slicing.",
      "While the chicken is baking, prepare the Panzanella. Cut the sourdough bread into cubes, then toast them in a dry skillet over medium heat until they are golden and crisp, about 5 minutes.",
      "In a large mixing bowl, combine the corn kernels, halved grape tomatoes, grated garlic, and toasted sourdough bread cubes.",
      "Pour the remaining half of the marinade over the corn and bread mixture, tossing gently to coat everything evenly.",
      "To serve, place the corn Panzanella on a plate, then slice the chicken and arrange it on top. Drizzle any extra pan juices over the chicken, if desired, and enjoy!",
      "A delicious reward for your efforts—savor every moment!"
