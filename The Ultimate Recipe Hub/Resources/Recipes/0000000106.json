      "Rinse the eggplant and pat dry. Apply a thin layer of oil over the surface.",

      "Peel off the charred skin and finely chop or mash the eggplant pulp.",

      "Stir in the red chili powder and mix well.",
      "Add the mashed eggplant and combine thoroughly with the onion-tomato mixture.",
      "Season with salt and cook for another 4-5 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld.",
