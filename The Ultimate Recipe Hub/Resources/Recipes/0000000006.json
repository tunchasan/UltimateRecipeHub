      "In a bowl, combine the gochujang, yogurt, and 3 cloves of minced garlic. Add the chicken thighs and toss to coat. Let marinate for at least 30 minutes or up to overnight.",
      "In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the remaining clove of minced garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add the rice and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2 minutes until lightly toasted.",
      "Pour in the chicken stock, bring to a simmer, then cover and reduce heat to low. Cook until the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. Remove from heat and let sit, covered, for 10 minutes.",
      "Preheat the broiler and set a rack 6 inches from the heat. Line a baking sheet with foil and set a wire rack on top. Remove the chicken from the marinade and place on the rack. Broil for 5 to 7 minutes per side, until charred and cooked through.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise and lemon juice. Thin with a little water, if needed, to reach a drizzly consistency.",
      "To serve, divide the rice among plates. Top with lettuce leaves, cherry tomatoes, and the broiled chicken. Drizzle with the lemon-mayo sauce."
