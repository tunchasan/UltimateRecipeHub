      "In a heavy-bottomed pan, heat the 1/3 cup butter over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until browned and nutty smelling. ",
      "Pour into a mixing bowl and allow to cool completely to room temperature.",
      "Preheat your oven to 350°F. Grease and lightly flour a 12-cup muffin tin.",
      "Add the sugar and egg to the cooled butter. Beat with an electric mixer until all creamed together, lightened in color, and fluffy (about 5 minutes).",
      "In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, salt, spices, and orange zest.",
      "Add the dry ingredients in increments to the butter-sugar mixture, alternating with the milk and beating until fully combined after each addition.",
      "Divide the batter evenly into the cups of the muffin tin. Bake until golden brown and fragrant, about 20-25 minutes.",
      "While the puffs are baking, put the melted butter in one shallow bowl and combine the sugar and cinnamon in another.",
      "When the puffs come out of the oven, use a knife to gently pop them all out of the muffin tin.",
      "One by one, dip each puff in the melted butter—get it all over it—then roll it in the cinnamon sugar. ",
      "Transfer to a serving platter and continue until all puffs are coated. Serve warm.",
      "Bon appétit! Your masterpiece is ready to be enjoyed."
