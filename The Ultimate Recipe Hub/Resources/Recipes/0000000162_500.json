      "In a medium heatproof bowl, combine dried porcini mushrooms and boiling water; let sit until softened, about 15 minutes. Drain mushrooms through a fine-mesh strainer set over another bowl, pressing to extract liquid. Reserve the mushroom liquid and finely chop the rehydrated mushrooms.",
      "While porcini mushrooms rehydrate, prepare fresh mushrooms: stem and halve portobellos, then cut into 1/2-inch pieces; trim and thinly slice white button or cremini mushrooms; tear trimmed oyster mushrooms into 1/2-inch pieces; stem and thinly slice shiitake mushrooms; cut trimmed maitake mushrooms into 1/2-inch pieces.",
      "Place serving plates in a low oven to keep warm. In a 3- or 5-quart saucier or medium Dutch oven, heat 2 tablespoons of the reserved sun-dried tomato oil over medium heat until shimmering. Add fresh mushrooms and 1/2 teaspoon salt; cook, stirring frequently, until moisture evaporates and mushrooms begin to brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Add remaining 1 tablespoon sun-dried tomato oil, onion, and minced porcini mushrooms; cook until onion is softened but not browned, about 5 minutes. Add sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and thyme; stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds.",
      "Add farro; cook, stirring frequently, until lightly toasted, about 2 minutes. Pour in white wine; cook, stirring constantly, until mostly evaporated, about 1 minute. Add reserved mushroom soaking liquid and cook, stirring, until mostly absorbed, about 2 minutes.",
      "Begin adding hot stock in 1/2-cup increments, stirring frequently and allowing each addition to be mostly absorbed before adding the next. Continue until farro is tender with a slight chew and suspended in a creamy sauce, 25 to 30 minutes. If more liquid is needed, add additional hot stock or water in 1/2-cup increments.",
      "Remove from heat; stir in Parmigiano-Reggiano, butter, chives, and sherry vinegar. Season with salt to taste. Serve immediately, garnished with additional cheese if desired."
