      "Bake for 30 minutes, stirring every 15 minutes to ensure even toasting.",
      "After 30 minutes, add the shaved coconut to the baking sheet and stir to combine. Continue baking for an additional 10 minutes, or until the granola is crispy but not burned. Keep a close eye on it during this time to prevent over-browning.",
      "Remove the granola from the oven and let it cool completely. Taste and, if desired, sprinkle a little brown sugar over the cooled granola for added sweetness.",
      "To assemble the breakfast bowls, divide the yogurt among four bowls. Top each with a generous handful of granola and a few spoonfuls of pomegranate seeds.",
      "Drizzle with honey or additional maple syrup, if desired, and serve immediately."
