      "In the same skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the sliced mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they release their moisture and become golden brown, about 5 minutes.",
      "Add the chopped shallots and minced garlic to the mushrooms and cook until softened, about 2 minutes.",
      "Pour in the Marsala wine, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Cook until the wine is reduced by half, about 2-3 minutes.",
      "In a small bowl, combine the chicken stock and unflavored gelatin, allowing the gelatin to bloom for a minute. Add this mixture to the skillet along with the soy sauce. Bring to a simmer and cook until slightly thickened, about 3 minutes.",
      "Return the browned chicken breasts to the skillet, spooning some of the sauce over each piece. Simmer until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened to your liking, about 5 minutes.",
      "Garnish with chopped fresh parsley, if desired, and serve immediately."
