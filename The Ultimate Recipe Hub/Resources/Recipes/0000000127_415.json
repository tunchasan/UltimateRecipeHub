    "steps": [
      "Heat the chicken stock in a saucepan. Add the chicken breasts and bring to a low simmer. Cover and cook for 10 minutes. Remove the chicken and set aside. Reserve the stock.",
      "Melt 25g of butter in a large saucepan over low heat. Add sliced leeks and cook gently for two minutes until softened. Add minced garlic and cook for an additional minute.",
      "Add the remaining butter to the pan. Once melted, stir in the flour and cook for 30 seconds, stirring constantly.",
      "Gradually add the milk, stirring continuously. Slowly incorporate 250ml of the reserved chicken stock and white wine, if using. Stir until the sauce is smooth and slightly thickened. Simmer gently for 3 minutes.",
      "Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Remove from heat and stir in the double cream. Pour the sauce into a bowl, cover with cling film to prevent a skin from forming, and set aside to cool.",
      "Preheat the oven to 200°C (400°F/Gas 6). Place a baking tray in the oven to heat.",
      "Roll out two-thirds of the shortcrust pastry on a floured surface to about 5mm thickness. Line a pie dish with the pastry, leaving excess overhanging the edges.",
      "Cut the cooked chicken into bite-sized pieces. Stir the chicken, diced ham, and leeks into the cooled sauce. Pour the filling into the prepared pastry-lined dish.",
      "Brush the rim of the pastry with beaten egg. Roll out the remaining pastry for the lid. Cover the pie with the pastry lid, pressing the edges together to seal. Trim any excess pastry.",
      "Make a small hole in the center of the pie to allow steam to escape. Brush the top with beaten egg.",
      "Place the pie on the preheated baking tray and bake for 35-40 minutes, or until golden brown and the filling is piping hot.",
      "Your creation is complete—now let the flavors shine!"
