      "Heat the oven to 400°F. In a large bowl, whisk the eggs, cheese, 1 teaspoon of the salt, and the black pepper; set aside.",
      "Trim ½ inch off the stem of the broccoli. Using a knife, separate all the florets from the base, leaving the stem attached. Cut the florets in half (you can cut any especially large ones into quarters so all are evenly sized).",
      "In a 10- to 11-inch oven-safe sauté pan over medium-high heat, warm ¼ cup of the oil.",
      "Cook the broccoli, mostly undisturbed to develop a nice brown color on one side, then turn and season with salt. ",
      "Transfer the pan to the oven and roast for 10 to 15 minutes, until tender.",
      "In another 10- to 11-inch sauté pan over medium-high heat, warm 2 tablespoons of the oil. ",
      "Add the onions, season with salt, and cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 to 5 minutes, until lightly browned.",
      "Once the broccoli is roasted, return the pan to the stovetop and reduce the oven temperature to 300°F.",
      "Heat the broccoli over medium heat, then add the garlic, red pepper flakes, and 1 tablespoon of the oil.",
      "Carefully cook, stirring occasionally, for 1 minute, so as not to burn the garlic. Add the onions to the broccoli and mix well to combine. Add the egg mixture, increase the heat to high, and cook for 30 seconds.",
      "Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, until the eggs are just set. Using a rubber spatula, turn out the frittata onto a serving plate. ",
      "Squeeze the lemon juice over the top, drizzle with oil, and sprinkle with Parmigiano Reggiano.",
      "A little effort, a lot of flavor—dig in and savor!"
