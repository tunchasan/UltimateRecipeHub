      "In a medium mixing bowl, combine flour and a pinch of salt.",

      "In a separate bowl, whisk together the egg and ice water.",
      "Gradually add the egg mixture to the flour mixture, stirring until the dough comes together. Form the dough into a ball, wrap in plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, slice the tomatoes thinly.",
      "On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to about 1/8-inch thickness.",
      "Using a 10-inch mixing bowl as a guide, cut out a circle from the rolled dough. Place the dough circle on a parchment-lined baking sheet.",
      "Spread a thin layer of mustard over the center of the dough, leaving a 1-inch border.",
      "Arrange the tomato slices over the mustard, overlapping them in a circular pattern.",
      "Fold the edges of the dough over the tomatoes, pleating as needed.",
      "Brush the crust with an egg wash made from a beaten egg and a little water.",
      "Drizzle the tomatoes with olive oil and sprinkle with pieces of goat cheese and Herbes de Provence.",
      "Bake for 15–20 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the tomatoes and goat cheese are cooked.",
      "Let the tart rest for a few minutes, then sprinkle with sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper to taste before serving.",
      "A dish made with love—enjoy every spoonful!"
