      "Pat salmon fillets dry with paper towels and season both sides with salt and pepper.",
      "Heat oil in a large stainless steel, cast iron, or carbon steel skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering.",
      "Carefully place salmon fillets skin-side down in the pan. Immediately press each fillet down with a flexible fish spatula to ensure full contact between the skin and the pan.",
      "Reduce heat to medium-low and continue cooking, pressing gently on the fillets occasionally, until the skin is crisp and the salmon is cooked about three-quarters of the way through, approximately 6 minutes.",
      "Flip the fillets and cook on the flesh side until the salmon reaches your desired level of doneness, about 1 to 2 minutes for medium-rare.",
      "Transfer salmon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain any excess oil. Serve immediately."
