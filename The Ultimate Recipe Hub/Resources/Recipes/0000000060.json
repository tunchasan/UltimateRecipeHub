      "Preheat the oven to 400°F. Toss the chopped beets with olive oil, salt, and pepper, and roast on a sheet pan until tender, about 25–30 minutes. Let cool slightly.",
      "In a small saucepan, bring the stock to a simmer and keep warm over low heat.",
      "In a large, wide-bottomed pan, melt butter over medium heat. Add minced shallots and sauté until translucent, about 2 minutes.",
      "Add the Arborio rice and stir to coat the grains in butter. Pour in the rosé wine, stirring constantly until it reduces and the alcohol evaporates.",
      "Lower the heat and ladle in the warm stock, one or two ladlefuls at a time, stirring constantly and allowing each addition to be absorbed before adding the next.",
      "Continue until the rice is al dente, about 18–20 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, puree the roasted beets with sour cream in a blender until smooth.",
      "When the risotto is cooked to your liking, stir in the beet-sour cream puree. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
      "Serve hot, garnished with chunks of goat cheese and chopped chives."
