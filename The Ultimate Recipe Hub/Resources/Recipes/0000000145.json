    "steps": [
      "Slice the eggplants into quarters lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 2-inch pieces. Place in a bowl and toss with 1 tablespoon sugar, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Let sit at room temperature for at least 20 minutes.",
      "Peel and thinly slice the garlic cloves. In a medium Dutch oven, heat the vegetable oil over medium-high heat. Add half of the sliced garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until light golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. Transfer the garlic chips to a plate and season lightly with salt.",
      "In the same pot, add the ground pork, breaking it into small pieces. Season with a pinch of salt and cook undisturbed until deeply browned underneath, about 5 minutes. Transfer to a plate, leaving the fat in the pot.",
      "Pat the eggplant pieces dry with a clean kitchen towel. Working in batches, cook the eggplant in the same pot until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Transfer to the plate with the pork.",
      "Pour 1½ cups of water into the pot, scraping up any browned bits. Add the remaining garlic, rice vinegar, soy sauce, bay leaves, remaining 1 tablespoon sugar, and 1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper. Bring to a simmer, then return the pork and eggplant to the pot.",
      "Reduce heat to medium-low, partially cover, and simmer until the eggplant is tender and the sauce is reduced by half, about 20–25 minutes. Adjust seasoning with more salt, pepper, or sugar if needed.",
      "Top with the reserved garlic chips and serve with cooked white rice.",
      "A job well done! Now enjoy your delicious dish."
