      "Add the minced garlic, chopped onions, celery, carrots, leeks, and swede. Sauté for 1–2 minutes.",
      "Pour in the red wine and beef stock. Add the bay leaves, thyme, and parsley. Season with Worcestershire sauce, balsamic vinegar, salt, and black pepper to taste.",
      "Cover the casserole with a lid and transfer to the preheated oven. Cook for approximately 2 hours, or until the beef is tender.",
      "To prepare the dumplings, sift the self-raising flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt into a bowl. Add the suet and enough water to form a thick dough.",
      "With floured hands, roll spoonfuls of the dough into small balls.",
      "After 2 hours, remove the lid from the stew and place the dumplings on top.",
      "Cover and return the casserole to the oven. Cook for an additional 20 minutes, or until the dumplings have expanded and are tender. For golden-topped dumplings, leave the lid off during this step.",
      "Serve the stew hot, garnished with additional chopped parsley if desired.",
