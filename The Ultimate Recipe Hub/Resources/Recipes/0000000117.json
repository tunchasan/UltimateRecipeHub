      "Preheat oven to 450°F (230°C). Wash and dry all produce. Cut sweet potatoes into ½-inch-thick wedges. Toss on a baking sheet with a drizzle of oil, salt, and pepper. Roast until browned and tender, 20-25 minutes.",
      "Meanwhile, halve and peel onion. Slice as thinly as possible until you have ¼ cup; finely chop remaining onion. Peel and finely chop garlic. Halve lime; squeeze juice into a small bowl. Halve buns.",
      "Add 1 tablespoon butter to a separate small microwave-safe bowl; microwave until melted, 30 seconds. Brush onto cut sides of buns.",
      "To bowl with lime juice, add sliced onion, ¼ teaspoon sugar, and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine; set aside to quick-pickle.",
      "Heat a drizzle of oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Add chopped onion and season with salt and pepper. ",
      "Cook, stirring, until softened, 4-5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds more. Add pork and season with salt and pepper. Cook, breaking up meat into pieces, until browned and cooked through, 4-6 minutes.",
      "While pork cooks, in a third small bowl, combine BBQ sauce, pickling liquid from onion, 3 tablespoons ketchup, ½ teaspoon sugar, and ¼ cup water. ",
      "Once pork is cooked through, add BBQ sauce mixture to pan. Cook, stirring, until sauce is thickened, 2-3 minutes. Taste and season with salt and pepper.",
      "Meanwhile, toast buns in oven or toaster oven until golden, 3-5 minutes. Divide toasted buns between plates and fill with as much BBQ pork as you’d like. Top with pickled onion and hot sauce. Serve with sweet potato wedges on the side.",
      "A dish made with love—enjoy every spoonful!"
