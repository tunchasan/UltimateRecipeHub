      "Blend all the mousse ingredients together in your food processor until smooth.",
      "Add the cacao powder first and, as you blend, have all the ingredients to hand in order to adjust the ratios slightly as the size of avocados and bananas varies.",
      "The perfect ratio to avoid the dish tasting too much of either is to use equal amounts of both.",
      "Taste and add a few drops of stevia if you feel you need more sweetness.",
      "Fill little cups or shot glasses with the mousse, sprinkle with cacao powder or nibs, and serve.",
      "Tip: If you don’t have a frozen banana to hand, you can use a normal one and then chill the mousse before serving for a cooling dessert.",
      "Your hard work has paid off—time to enjoy!"
