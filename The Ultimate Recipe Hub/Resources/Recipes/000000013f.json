    "steps": [
      "Peel and cut the potatoes into even, medium-sized chunks. Put them in a large pan filled with cold salted water, bring to the boil, and cook for 10-15 minutes until a knife can be inserted into the potatoes easily.",
      "Meanwhile, melt the butter in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the garlic, cabbage, spring onions, and some seasoning. Stir occasionally until the cabbage is wilted but still retains a little bite, then set aside.",
      "Drain the potatoes, leave to steam-dry for a couple of minutes, then mash with the cream, mustard, and seasoning in the same saucepan. Stir in the cabbage and ham hock. Keep warm over low heat.",
      "Reheat the pan used to cook the cabbage (no need to wash first), add a splash of oil, crack in the eggs, and fry to your liking. To serve, divide the colcannon between bowls and top each with a fried egg.",
      "Your creation is complete—now let the flavors shine!"
