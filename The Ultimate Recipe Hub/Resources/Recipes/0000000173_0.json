      "Reduce the heat to low and pour the almond milk mixture into the skillet with the tofu. Stir to combine and cook for an additional 3 minutes, allowing the flavors to meld. Season with salt and pepper to taste.",
      "Lay a tortilla on a clean work surface. Arrange a layer of spinach leaves in the center of the tortilla. Top with a portion of the tofu scramble, black beans, avocado slices, roasted red bell pepper, pickled red onions, and serrano pepper slices. Sprinkle with a pinch of salt and a squeeze of fresh lime juice.",
      "Fold the bottom flap of the tortilla up and over the filling. Then, tuck in the sides and roll the filling towards the top of the tortilla to seal the burrito. Repeat with the remaining tortillas and fillings.",
      "Serve the burritos immediately with salsa on the side, or wrap them tightly in foil and freeze for up to 2 months. To reheat, thaw a burrito in the refrigerator overnight and microwave for about 30 seconds until heated through."
