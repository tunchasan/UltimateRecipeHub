    "steps": [
      "Bring a medium saucepan of generously salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until al dente, about 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and set aside.",
      "In a small bowl, whisk together the flour, mustard powder, 1/2 teaspoon garlic powder, kosher salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper.",
      "In the same saucepan, melt 85 grams of butter over low heat. Whisk in the flour mixture and cook until it begins to brown and has a nutty aroma, about 1 minute.",
      "Slowly whisk in the whole milk and heavy cream until well combined. Cook, whisking constantly, until the sauce begins to thicken, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat.",
      "Gradually add the Monterey Jack cheese to the sauce, stirring until melted. Stir in the cooked macaroni until well coated.",
      "Line a 9-by-13-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and coat with nonstick spray or butter. Spread the mac and cheese evenly in the pan. Place another piece of parchment paper on top, pressing it onto the surface. Refrigerate until firm, about 1 hour.",
      "In a small bowl, combine 55 grams of softened butter with 1 teaspoon of garlic powder.",
      "Once the mac and cheese is firm, cut it into 8 equal pieces.",
      "Spread the garlic butter on one side of each bread slice. Place half of the slices, buttered side down, on a cutting board. Top each with a slice of cheddar cheese, a piece of the mac and cheese, and another slice of Monterey Jack cheese. Top with the remaining bread slices, buttered side up.",
      "Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Place the sandwiches in the skillet and cook until the bottoms are browned, about 4 minutes. Flip and cook until the other side is browned and the cheeses are melted, about 4 more minutes.",
      "Serve the sandwiches warm.",
      "A job well done! Now enjoy your delicious dish."
