      "To make the green piri-piri sauce, combine the basil leaves, parsley leaves, jalapeño, sherry vinegar, spring onions, half a garlic clove, caster sugar, and 1 tablespoon of water in a blender. Blend until as smooth as possible. This will make more than needed for the recipe but will keep for a week in an airtight jar.",
      "Heat a griddle or frying pan to high. Remove the garlic and parsley stalks from the steaks and season well. Sear the steaks for 2 minutes on each side, then rest on a plate. ",
      "Place the ciabatta halves onto the plate, toasted-side down, to soak up any juices.",
