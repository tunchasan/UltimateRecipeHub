    "steps": [
      "Heat your oven to 400°F. Wash your sweet potatoes and score them with an 'X'. Place them on a baking sheet and bake until very soft, close to an hour.",
      "Allow to cool, remove the peels, and press the potatoes through a potato ricer. Measure out one cup of the mashed sweet potato.",
      "In a mixing bowl, stir together the sweet potato mash, ricotta, salt, and egg until combined. ",
      "Then, stir in the flour 1/4 cup at a time, just until you have a workable dough. It will be sticky; use as little flour as possible to keep the gnocchi light.",
      "Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and keep your hands floured as well. Divide it into four pieces and roll each piece into a log about an inch thick.",
      "Using a sharp knife, cut the logs into 1-inch pieces. Optionally, use the back of a fork to press tine marks into your gnocchi. ",
      "If not cooking immediately, refrigerate them or freeze them on a baking sheet, then store in the freezer. Do not defrost frozen gnocchi; cook them directly from frozen.",
      "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Gently add about half of your gnocchi. Boil until they rise to the surface, then scoop them out with a slotted spoon and place in a bowl. Repeat with the remaining gnocchi.",
      "For the maple-butter sauce: In a frying pan, melt the butter over medium heat. ",
      "Add the orange zest, maple syrup, orange juice, rum (if using), and cinnamon. Stir to combine and let it cook for a couple of minutes until it thickens slightly.",
      "Add the cooked gnocchi to the sauce, stirring to coat them well. Cook them on medium for a minute or two on each side, until they look a little golden.",
      "Divide the gnocchi between four bowls and sprinkle each with the toasted pecans. Serve warm.",
      "Bon appétit! Your masterpiece is ready to be enjoyed."
